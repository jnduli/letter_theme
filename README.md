# MinCss Letter Theme #
I recently started using pelican and decided to make my own theme.
So far it is still a work in progress but I hope to complete it
soon.

The theme is based off min css.

Anyway I'll add more information on it as I further develop it.

# Installation #
To install the theme:
1. Set up any pelican based site:
2. I use this for my blog:
   https://github.com/jnduli/blog_jnduli.co.ke
3. Then clone into that git repo and follow its setup instructions.
4. Clone into this theme.
5. Open pelicanconf.py file in site and add path to theme at the
   THEME variable
6. You can then Make hmtl to see the theme in action
